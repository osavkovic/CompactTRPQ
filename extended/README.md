Currently, the LaTeX template used in this extended version is not the LLNCS template used for the submitted paper.
The reason is that this is a previous version of the paper, submitted last year to another conference (and rejected).

We have updated the introduction as well as the figures, and have used a slightly different notation in some places.
However, the results are identical, and the proofs are not affected.

We are in the process of harmonizing this (essentially switching to the LLNCS template and fixing a few macros).
The updated version should be online in a few hours.
